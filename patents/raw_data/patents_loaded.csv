A figure comprises a body member simulating a head and shoulders with two arm members rotationally connected to the body member at the simulated shoulders. An outer string line is connected between the parallel support rods near one end of the frame and passes through inner openings of the arm members. An inner string line is connected between the parallel support rods parallel to and adjacent the outer string line and passes through outer openings of the arm members. When the frame is placed in a vertical position with the figure at the top, gravity will cause the body member to move around the inner and outer string lines to take an upside-up position below the inner string line, which causes the inner and outer string lines to cross each other. When the ends of the parallel support rods at the bottom of the frame are moved toward each other, the parallel string lines are pulled back to a parallel position so that the body member counter rotates around the inner and outer string lines back to an upside-up position beneath the inner string line, which causes the inner and outer string lines to cross each other, but in an opposite direction. Repeated movement toward each other of the bottom ends of the parallel support rods causes the body member to repeatedly rotate and counter rotate around the inner and outer string lines.
